# COMP 584 Project README

## Project Overview

As the primary assignment for this class, you will build an advanced Web application. The required components of the application are the following:

### Required Components

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: This is a "must" for a grade of C or above!
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Ensure your server follows the MVC pattern.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Your application should include at least two tables with a one-to-many relationship between them using Entity Framework Core.
- **Authentication**: Implement Google SSO via Firebase Authentication and Duo for Multi-Factor Authentication.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the frontend using Firebase Hosting and the backend using AWS.

Fulfilling these requirements will make a B grade.

### Additional Components for an A Grade

Other ways to achieve an A grade are the following:

- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using ASP.NET Identity or Firebase.
- **Complex Data Entry (Reactive Forms)**: Use Angular Reactive Forms for form handling and validation.
- **Server-initiated communications (e.g., SignalR)**: Implement real-time communication between frontend and backend using SignalR.
- **Unit Testing**: Use Jasmine for frontend testing and xUnit for backend testing.
- **Third-party Identity Providers (e.g., Google via Firebase Authentication)**

## Development Stack

We are going to build this application throughout the class. The server side requires ASP.NET/C#. I will use and recommend Angular on the client; however, you can use React on the client as well.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment with ASP.NET/C# for the server side.
2. Choose either Angular or React for the client side and set up the environment accordingly.
3. Begin implementing the required components listed above.
4. Add additional components to aim for an A grade.

## Deployment

Instructions for deploying your application will be provided later in the course.
