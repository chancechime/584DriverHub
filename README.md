# COMP 584 Project README

## Project Overview

As the primary assignment for this class, you will build an advanced Web application. The required components of the application are the following:

### Required Components

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: This is a "must" for a grade of C or above!
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Ensure your server follows the MVC pattern.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Your application should include at least two tables with a one-to-many relationship between them using Entity Framework Core.
- **Authentication**: Implement Google SSO via Firebase Authentication and Duo for Multi-Factor Authentication.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the front end using Firebase Hosting and the back end using AWS.

Fulfilling these requirements will make a B grade.

### Additional Components for an A Grade

Other ways to achieve an A grade are the following:

- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using ASP.NET Identity or Firebase.
- **Complex Data Entry (Reactive Forms)**: Use Angular Reactive Forms for form handling and validation.
- **Server-initiated communications (e.g., SignalR)**: Implement real-time communication between frontend and backend using SignalR.
- **Unit Testing**: Use Jasmine for frontend testing and xUnit for backend testing.
- **Third-party Identity Providers (e.g., Google via Firebase Authentication)**

## Development Stack

The server side requires ASP.NET/C#. I will use Angular on the client. The Database using Azure SQL Database
